This is my first website in ReactJS. It uses React hooks to fetch data from two of [NASA's APIs](https://api.nasa.gov/); **Astronomy Picture of the Day** and **Near Earth Object Web Service**.  

## About This Project
* View NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day or browse their near earth asteroid database by date. Tap (mobile) or click (desktop) into individual asteroids to get more details, or further to view its orbit.

## View Online 
* The website is live at [Netlify](http://hacking-nasa.netlify.com).
